# Project specs

## What, why and who...?

This project shall help e.g. shared flat economies to keep track on their expenses like monthly food budgets, etc.
It is supposed to be a rather simple app comprising an arbitrary amount of expense lists, where participants of a shared flat,
solidarity based economy or similar community can keep track of their expenses in order to avoid financial black holes and the like.

## User stories

#### Basic functionality

* As a user I want to add an arbitrary amount of expense lists
* As a user I want to add, edit and delete expenses to and from a specific expense list

#### Email notification

* As a participating user of an expense list I want to get notified...
  a) about changes in within the list (new entries, deletions, edits)
  b) whenever the sum of expenses so far reach a critical level
